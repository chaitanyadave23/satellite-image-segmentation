# satellite-image-segmentation
Image segmentation using digital image processing on satellite images is performed to differentiate between different landscapes. K-means Clustering for color based segmentation and Otsu algorithm for finding the optimum threshold is applied which is used further to formulate watershed segmentation algorithm.
